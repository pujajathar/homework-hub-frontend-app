        <h3>Why AaruEdu?</h3>
        <p>
            AaruEdu was inspired by my own experience as a parent of elementary school children.<br/>
            I wanted to create a simple solution that helps families and teachers stay connected while reducing the stress of 
            keeping track of paper assignments.
